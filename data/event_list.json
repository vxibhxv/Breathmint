Before you can say anything, she lays her head on the bar and snores softly.",""Keep em coming big man" you say to the bartender, who freezes you in place with a high Korean eyebrow arch. Oof, a classic.\n"Just Put it on her tab", you suggest. The bartender rumbles. "No."", "The bartender steals a glance at the sleeping, drooling woman next to you. "The Ranger Monument.
